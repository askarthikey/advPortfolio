      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am an aspiring software engineer with a strong foundation in web development, programming, and problem-solving. My passion lies in building scalable applications that not only enhance user experiences but also push the boundaries of innovation. Skilled in full-stack development and database management, I am committed to continuous learning and staying ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape.

Beyond technology, I have a deep interest in traveling and exploring new places, as I believe every journey offers a fresh perspective and an opportunity to learn. I am also fascinated by human behavior and enjoy reading psychology books, which help me understand decision-making, cognitive processes, and problem-solving from a different lens. Combining my technical expertise with my curiosity for exploration and psychology, I strive to create intuitive and impactful digital solutions.</p>
